                <p>
                    My name is Yemny Feliz and I am studying full-stack web development at a bootcamp program offered by Rutgers University.
                    I previously was pursuing a career in elementary school education.
                    I graduated from Atlantic Cape Community College with a 4.0 GPA and I hold an Associate's degree in Liberal Arts - Elementary School Education.
                    Although teaching was my first career choice technology was always fascinating to me.
                    I was curious to learn about how websites are created so I researched the topic and fell in love with it.
                    Besides offering a great opportunity for growth, coding websites is challenging and allows me to expand my imagination and be creative.
                    It's like a magical world.<br>

                    <br>Through the program, I have acquired skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub.
                    I am excited to continue learning and soon, I will be skilled in APIs, Node.js, OOP, Express.js, SQL, React, and more.
